## Overview

The CRM Email Notification Template Simplifier is a module designed to simplify the
appearance of CRM email notifications/email in order to avoid them being
marked as spam or ending up in the recipient's junk folder.

## How it Works

elements, inline styles, or other formatting that might trigger spam filters.
It also streamlines the content of the email to make it easier to read and understand.
